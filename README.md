I, D Siddhant Patro, have completed all of the given machine learning task successfully. 
Through out this internship, I have learnt a lot of new topics under machine learning which are very useful for starting a career in data science field. 
In this internship, I have used Linear Regression, Decision Tree, train test split method, statsmodel.api method, matplotlib, pandas, numpy etc techniques to complete the given task for predicting values and plotting the resulting graph.
From the given student dataset, i have learnt, how to do cleaning of a given dataset, choosing a model, training and testing it and atlast predicting the future values. In this internship task i have learnt the basics of data cleaning, since data cleaning is the most important part for predicting the future values of a machine learning project successfully.
Till now i have worked on projects such as 'Loan Prediction', 'Housing price prection', 'Iris flowers classification', 'Stock price prediction', 'Wine quality test project' using Machine Learning.
I have planned to work on speech and image recognition project, sentiment analysis project using machine learning after learning more about algorithms.
Since Machine learning is a very vast field, where there are a lot of interesting topics to be learnt and practiced and opportunities to be prevailed. So after getting all the required in-depth knowledge about machine learning and data science, i will be able to perform advanced project.
