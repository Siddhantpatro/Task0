I, D Siddhant Patro, have completed all of the given machine learning task successfully. 
Through out this internship, I have learnt a lot of new topics under machine learning which are very useful for starting a career in data science field. 
In this internship, I have used Linear Regression, Decision Tree, train test split method, statsmodel.api method, matplotlib, pandas, numpy etc techniques to complete the given task by predicting values and plotting the resulting graph.
Till now i have not worked on any real time project, but from now onwords, i am confident that i can work on real time project.
From the given student dataset, i have learnt, how can one predict the future grade of a student using machine learning algorithms
I always wanted to work on speech recognition project, since Machine learning is a very vast field, where there are a lot of interesting topic to be learnt and practiced. So after getting all the required knowledge about machine learning, i will be able to perform my speech recognition project.
